### Entering into a GitHub classroom organization
1. Provide your instructor with your GitHub username. They must invite you to join the organization.
2. Once they have sent you an invite, check your email and accept the invite to join the organization.

### Viewing and accepting assessments
1. Open up Source Academy webpage and navigate to Classrooms.
2. Log into your GitHub account (this must be the same one that is a member of the classroom/organization).
3. Browse the "Select Course" dropdown menu and select the course that has the assessment.
4. Navigate to the correct assessment category.
5. The assessment should show up near the top of the list of cards in the page with an "accept" button. If the button is "open" you have accepted the assessment already and can attempt it right away.
6. Click on the accept button to be redirected to GitHub Classroom.
7. Follow instructions to clone the assessment and it should now be available to attempt on Source Academy Classrooms.

### Attempting and submitting assessments
1. For programming questions, you can write your answers in the code editor on the left. For multiple-choice questions, you can click on the answer.
2. Some questions have test cases that you can view through the test case tab on the right. To run individual test cases, you may click on them. Otherwise to run all the test cases, you can run the program while the test case tab is selected.
3. When you are satisfied with your answers, remember to click on "Save" to save your changes. You can check the repository on GitHub to ensure that your changes are carried over.
